# Snake Game in Java

This repository contains a simple Snake Game implemented in Java using Swing for GUI.

## Description

This project is a classic Snake Game where the player controls a snake that moves around the screen, eating food to grow longer. The game ends when the snake collides with itself or with the boundaries of the screen.

**Note:** This project is a work in progress. We aim to add the following features:

### Todo:
- Improve physics
- Add timer

### In Progress:
- Choice of character
- Points counter
- Better scaled images

### Done:

## How to Play

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Compile and run the `SnakeGame.java` file.
3. Use the arrow keys to control the movement of the snake.
4. Eat food to grow longer and avoid colliding with walls or yourself.
